The POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) Act, 2013 mandates workplaces to have Internal Complaints Committees (ICC). 
Employees facing harassment must first report the incident to the ICC. 

The ICC investigates complaints and recommends corrective measures. 
Failure to follow POSH guidelines may lead to penalties for the employer. 

Key documents: complaint letter, any email/text evidence, and witness statements. Optional: CCTV footage or medical reports. 
Limitation period: complaints should be filed within three months from the date of the incident.
