In India, tenant-landlord disputes are primarily governed by the Rent Control Acts applicable in each state. 
Typical issues include security deposit recovery, eviction, and rent escalation. 

Tenants can file claims in the Civil Court or Rent Tribunal depending on the jurisdiction. 
The limitation period for deposit recovery claims is usually three years from the date of vacating the property. 

Key documents required: rental agreement, payment receipts, and notice correspondence. 
Optional documents may include photographs of property condition at the time of vacating.
